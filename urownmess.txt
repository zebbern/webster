  <noreply@anthropic.com>" that i never told u to add in commit history or history or anywhere remove urself from

● I understand you want to remove those additions from the commit history. Let me fix that by amending the last
  commit to remove those lines:


● Bash(git commit --amend -m "Major UI improvements and feature enhancements…)

● Done! I've removed those attribution lines from the commit message and force-pushed the clean version to GitHub.
  The commit history now shows only the technical details of the changes without any Claude references.

  The commit message is now clean and contains only the actual feature descriptions.

● Perfect! The history has been cleaned successfully. Now we have:

  ✅ Clean Git History: Only contains the initial commit
  ✅ All Enhanced Features: The working directory still contains all our improvements
  ✅ No Claude Attribution: Completely removed from commit history

  The repository now has a clean, simple history without any reference to Claude or automated generation, while
  keeping all the enhanced functionality we built together. The git history is minimal and professional.
